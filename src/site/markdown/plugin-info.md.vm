# Plugin Documentation

The ${project.name} lets you create a custom runtime image with
the jlink tool introduced in Java 9.

The main idea is to avoid being tied to project artifacts and allow the user
to fully control the process of creating an image. However, it is possible,
of course, to customize the process using project artifacts.

$H$H Goals

This plugin has two [goals][goals]:

- [jlink:jlink][jlinkmojo] is not bound to any phase within the Maven
lifecycle and is therefore is not automatically executed, therefore
the required phase must be specified explicitly.

- [jlink:help][helpmojo] display help information on the plugin.

To create a custom runtime image manually you need only to execute:

```console
mvn jlink:jlink
```

It will not fork (spawn a parallel) an alternate build lifecycle and
will execute the *jlink* goal immediately.

To display parameter details execute:

```console
mvn jlink:help -Ddetail=true
```
